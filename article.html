			Synopsis:
		</p>

<p>Tricia Levenseller, author of Daughter of the Pirate King, is back with an epic YA tale of ambition and love in The Shadows Between Us…</p>

<p>“They’ve never found the body of the first and only boy who broke my heart. And they never will.”</p>

Alessandra is tired of being overlooked, but she has a plan to gain power:<br>
1) Woo the Shadow King.<br>
2) Marry him.<br>
3) Kill him and take his kingdom for herself.<br>

<p>No one knows the extent of the freshly crowned Shadow King’s power. Some say he can command the shadows that swirl around him to do his bidding. Others say they speak to him, whispering the thoughts of his enemies. Regardless, Alessandra knows what she deserves, and she’s going to do everything within her power to get it.</p>

<p>But Alessandra’s not the only one trying to kill the king. As attempts on his life are made, she finds herself trying to keep him alive long enough for him to make her his queen―all while struggling not to lose her heart. After all, who better for a Shadow King than a cunning, villainous queen?</p>

<p>“Tricia Levenseller’s latest, The Shadows Between Us, is a decadent and wickedly addictive fantasy, full of schemes and court intrigue, and delightful descriptions of food, which I am always a fan of.” ―Kendare Blake, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Three Dark Crowns series</p>

<p>The Shadow Between Us is a standalone fantasy novel by Tricia Levenseller and my first encounter with her writing. It is described as Slytherin romance and has a love story of a villain. It was unlike any other book a completely different story of a girl who was real , not the usual kind of female protagonist who is kind , polite and humble but she is a real badass with all her flaws depicted very beautifully by the author.it is a passionate love story between two young souls who are driven by passion for their success and would do anything to achieve what their heart desires.</p>

"I have it all .The  power. The kingdom. The man."<br>

<p>Alessandra is the second daughter of a nobleman who wants to marry his daughter to someone of high worth and status. She is often overlooked and is always deemed of lower caliber than her older sister who is loved dearly by their father. But she is no damsel in distress and have quite high ambitions for herself  and is determined to achieve it. she wants to woo the shadow king ,marry him , kill him and become the queen of the kingdom and rule over .Her ambition and determination to achieve her goal is something pretty admirable and inspirable. She is unapologetically brutal and a master manipulator  who knows how to win a person and take what she wants from them. She is a feminist who bends the rules for women of what they can do in this world and uses her power to shatter some of the rules .Her ambition and humor just brings life to the character.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of who you are .Say what you wish .Be who you wish. Don't try to be someone else."</p>

<p>Kallius is an equally interesting character who is not like our noble hero and is equally ruthless and ambitious in his desires .He is our very own cruel king who is willing to shed blood for keeping his subjects and people faithful. He wants to conquer the surrounding kingdoms and become the most powerful king alive. There are rumours about his power all over the kingdom but no one knows exactly what his powers are some say he can read minds other say he can control minds but no knows for sure.</p>

"In you I found my match. In you I found my equal"<br>

<p>The story was quite predictable with a little bit of a twist in the end. The character setting and appearances were depicted beautifully and portrayed skillfully, the ending was safe and could have been better with an epilogue .But all in all the book is quite  gripping with its descriptive narrative. It's dark but quite interesting and pleasing.</p>

"Doing the right thing is not always easy. And being the bigger person ,the first to reach out with kindness ,takes great  strength of character."
